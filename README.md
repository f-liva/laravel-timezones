# Laravel Timezones

Dealing with timezones can be a frustrating experience. Here's an attempt to brighten your day.

**The problem:** it is commonly agreed that dates should be stored as `UTC` datetimes in the database, which generally means they also need to be adapted for the local timezone before manipulation or display. Laravel provides a `app.timezone` configuration, making it possible to start working with timezones. However, changing that configuration will affect both the stored and manipulated date's timezones. This package tries to address this by providing a timezone conversion mechanism that should perform most of the repetitive timezone configurations out of the box.

```php
// Model:
protected $casts = [
    'occurred_at' => TimezonedDatetime::class,
];

// Set a custom timezone
Timezone::set('Europe/Brussels');

// Display dates stored as UTC in the app's timezone:
// (database value: 2022-12-13 09:00:00)
echo $model->occurred_at->format('d.m.Y H:i'); // Output: 13.12.2022 10:00

// Store dates using automatic UTC conversion:
$model->occurred_at = '2022-12-13 20:00:00';
$model->save(); // Database value: 2022-12-13 19:00:00
```

## Installation

```bash
composer require whitecube/laravel-timezones
```

## Getting started

The `app.timezone` configuration setting has to be set to the timezone that should be used when saving dates in the database. We highly recommend keeping it as `UTC` since it's a global standard for dates storage.

For in-app date manipulation and display, one would expect more flexibility. That's why it is possible to set the application's timezone dynamically by updating the `timezone` singleton instance. Depending on the app's context, please choose one that suits your situation best:

### 1. Using middleware

Useful when the app's timezone should be set by ther user's settings.

```php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;
 
use Closure;
use Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Facades\Timezone;
 
class DefineApplicationTimezone
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        Timezone::set($request->user()->timezone ?? 'Europe/Brussels');
 
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

### 2. Using a Service Provider

Useful when the app's timezone should be set by the application itself. For instance, in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`:

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Facades\Timezone;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Timezone::set('America/Toronto');
    }
}
```

## Usage

Once everything's setup, the easiest way to manipulate dates configured with the app's current timezone is to use the `TimezonedDatetime` or `ImmutableTimezonedDatetime` cast types on your models:

```php
use Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Casts\TimezonedDatetime;
use Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Casts\ImmutableTimezonedDatetime;

/**
 * The attributes that should be cast.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $casts = [
    'published_at' => TimezonedDatetime::class,
    'birthday' => ImmutableTimezonedDatetime::class . ':Y-m-d',
];
```

In other scenarios, feel free to use the `Timezone` Facade directly for more convenience:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Facades\Timezone;

// Get the current date configured with the current timezone:
$now = Timezone::now();

// Create a date using the current timezone:
$date = Timezone::date('2023-01-01 00:00:00');
// Alternatively, set the timezone manually on a Carbon instance:
$date = new Carbon('2023-01-01 00:00:00', Timezone::current());


// Convert a date to the current timezone:
$date = Timezone::date(new Carbon('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 'UTC'));
// Alternatively, set the application timezone yourself:
$date = (new Carbon('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 'UTC'))->setTimezone(Timezone::current());

// Convert a date to the storage timezone:
$date = Timezone::store(new Carbon('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 'Europe/Brussels'));
// Alternatively, set the storage timezone yourself:
$date = (new Carbon('2023-01-01 00:00:00', 'Europe/Brussels'))->setTimezone(Timezone::storage());
```

## Assigning values to cast attributes

Many developers are used to assign Carbon instances to date attributes:

```php
$model->published_at = Carbon::create($request->published_at);
```

**This can lead to unexpected behavior** because the assigned Carbon instance will default to the `UTC` timezone, whereas the provided value was probably meant for another timezone. The datetime string will be stored as-is without shifting its timezone accordingly first. 

In order to prevent this, it is recommended to let the Cast do the heavy lifting:

```php
$model->published_at = $request->published_at;
```

The package will now treat the provided datetime string using the correct Timezone (for instance, `Europe/Brussels`) and store the shifted `UTC` value in the database correctly.

A more verbose (but also correct) method would be to create the Carbon instance using the `Timezone` facade :

```php
$model->published_at = Carbon::create($request->published_at, Timezone::current());
// Or, shorthand:
$model->published_at = Timezone::date($request->published_at);
```

**This is not a bug**, it is intended behavior since one should be fully aware of the Carbon instance's timezone before assigning it.

### Edge cases

If you need to use the `TimezonedDatetime` cast on the timestamp columns (`created_at` and/or `updated_at`) AND you're expecting to handle dates with timezones other than UTC or the one you've defined with `Timezone::set()`, you will need to apply the `Whitecube\LaravelTimezones\Concerns\HasTimezonedTimestamps` trait on your model.

This is necessary to prevent Laravel's casting of those attributes to occur, which would transform the value in a way where the timezone information is lost, preventing our cast from working properly.

An example of a case where you need to use the trait:

```php
Timezone::set('Europe/Brussels');

$model->created_at = new Carbon('2022-12-15 09:00:00', 'Asia/Taipei');
```
